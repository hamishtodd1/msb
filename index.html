	Script for "murder mystery", sock puppets:
        Ahh help I'm being murdered
            BUT WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS??
        Hello, I'm his estranged wife, and I must admit I really grew to dislike him
        I'm his Butler. I really liked him but it must be said that I had motive to 
        pause
        Didn't he say something about readjusting his will tomorrow?

        Hello. Well, I'm a Butler. But I certainly didn't do it
        AND I... AM... a random passer by, I don't know who that is at all
        Really? I could swear I've seen you around
        Nope, honestly never been here before. Are you sure you didn't do it?
        Well, ok, to be honest I did do it, I just couldn't stand him any more
        Alright I guess that clears that up
        OR DOES IT?
        No, yes, it's cleared up, it was definitely me
        THE END

        Oh alright, it was me actually

        Me: This man has been killed! But who was it?
        A: Well, I never liked him anyway
        B: I liked him a lot, although I do wish he would keep away from my poisonous frog collection
        Hmm, there is also his ex wife, who appears to have absconded to the bahamas
        Oh, it turns out it was me

    Could also do this with:
        Who's going to end up with whom in a rom com
        Who will win football

    one might get things like the radiolab "Buy and then immediately sell when you see the price"
    different name: "the hansonian betting board". Bet on anything you like
    advantage this might have over board game: you don't have to look down and check whether
        you've got bets on a character you've lost faith in being guilty,
        you can just immediately go over and decrease your bet

	<h3>The rules:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>You will watch a Murder Mystery, with several suspects, all of whom may be <em>guilty</em>.</li>
		<li>Any player can raise suspicion of a new suspect they would like to bet on.</li>
		<li>The guilt of the suspects is determined when, and ONLY WHEN, the credits roll.</li>
		<li>With guilt determined, bets on guilty suspects are worth money, bets on innocents are worthless.</li>
	</ol>
