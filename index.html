		If your display goes to sleep, the socket goes

		This-is-not-an-advert in order to make sounds play
		Check that the connection is ok, took several seconds to send you your pic back

	Restart button might be nice, requires two presses
	Can get more playtesters from:
		StrangeCharms
		GMTK
	Could have an automated thing: when you buy a bet, however much extra probability this puts into the suspect, that much is sold, equally, from the other suspects
	Possibly betting on "who should be put on the pitch" in a football simulator
	Mute button for sound effects
	The bets have their color fade to green and come from the bottom and the top
	You need a more detailed arrow, apparently people can be close
	Also, hide your cash when done
	Lobbyist mode
		With lobbyist mode, you also have a lot of bets more expensive than what the person gets for them. Then, a strategy: if you know someone is trying to manipulate the price of X to be >80p at 1pm, but the true price of X is 20p, you can:
		-buy a load of bets on X at <80p
		-wait until 12:59pm when the price is 81p
		-sell a bet, price goes down to 79p
		-watch the manipulator buy so price goes back to 81p
		-sell again
		-manipulator buys again
		etc. Only problem is, you have to buy when 

		Yes, key thing is that there should be unlimited bets, so that the manipulator is forced to make the price extraordinarily high so that when everyone sells it's still above the watermark

		If you can figure out how much the manipulator gains from having the price be past the watermark, you can pump all that money out of them



		No reason why it should be secret really. Say how much cash the manipulator gets, and who they are, and what suspect they're going for.

		Easter egg: open console and set newGameButton.manipulatorMode = true before clicking it

		-how much money they get
		-how much extra money they start with
		-When the suspect appears, a 25-second timer starts. If the suspect's bets are trading at 1:1 when it's done, the manipulator gets N dollars.

	"World's shortest mrder mystery"
	Script for "murder mystery", sock puppets:
        Ahh help I'm being murdered
            BUT WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS??
        Hello, I'm his estranged wife, and I must admit I really grew to dislike him
        I'm his Butler. I really liked him but it must be said that I had motive to 
        pause
        Didn't he say something about readjusting his will tomorrow?

        Hello. Well, I'm a Butler. But I certainly didn't do it
        AND I... AM... a random passer by, I don't know who that is at all
        Really? I could swear I've seen you around
        Nope, honestly never been here before. Are you sure you didn't do it?
        Well, ok, to be honest I did do it, I just couldn't stand him any more
        Alright I guess that clears that up
        OR DOES IT?
        No, yes, it's cleared up, it was definitely me
        THE END

        Oh alright, it was me actually

        Me: This man has been killed! But who was it?
        A: Well, I never liked him anyway
        B: I liked him a lot, although I do wish he would keep away from my poisonous frog collection
        Hmm, there is also his ex wife, who appears to have absconded to the bahamas
        Oh, it turns out it was me

    Could also do this with:
        Who's going to end up with whom in a rom com
        Who will win football

		<li>You will watch a Murder Mystery, with several suspects, all of whom may be <em>guilty</em>.</li>
		<li>Any player can raise suspicion of a new suspect they would like to bet on.</li>
		<li>The guilt of the suspects is determined when, and ONLY WHEN, the credits roll.</li>
		<li>With guilt determined, bets on guilty suspects are worth money, bets on innocents are worthless.</li>
