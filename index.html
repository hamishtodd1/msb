	Auto-refresh also puts in the game id
	Going into debt
	Starting with 0
	Quite awful bug if you... hit the new suspect button twice at the start? On mobile?
	Refund when suspect is deleted?
		That's more for "unresolved" rather than "resolved in the negative"
		Want to incentivize them to sell, and in a certain order, selling is part of the game
		If you were to do this, it would be a case of tracking who still has some cash in there
		and giving them the most you can give them
	Could make it so ctrl+v puts a pasted image in the camera feed, useful for desktop
		Even text could go in, could use drop down window
	probably best not to scale up cash width because think about initial cash
	
	Lobbyist mode
		With lobbyist mode, you also have a lot of bets more expensive than what the person gets for them. Then, a strategy: if you know someone is trying to manipulate the price of X to be >80p at 1pm, but the true price of X is 20p, you can:
		-buy a load of bets on X at <80p
		-wait until 12:59pm when the price is 81p
		-sell a bet, price goes down to 79p
		-watch the manipulator buy so price goes back to 81p
		-sell again
		-manipulator buys again
		etc. Only problem is, you have to buy when 

		Yes, key thing is that there should be unlimited bets, so that the manipulator is forced to make the price extraordinarily high so that when everyone sells it's still above the watermark

		If you can figure out how much the manipulator gains from having the price be past the watermark, you can pump all that money out of them



		No reason why it should be secret really. Say how much cash the manipulator gets, and who they are, and what suspect they're going for.

		Easter egg: open console and set newGameButton.manipulatorMode = true before clicking it

		-how much money they get
		-how much extra money they start with
		-When the suspect appears, a 25-second timer starts. If the suspect's bets are trading at 1:1 when it's done, the manipulator gets N dollars.

		Alt
			Manipulator  will get 1 googol dollars from the market price being above 1
			So they're willing to lose .9999 = 1 googol dollars
			To bet, if there are 10 bets
	Another fun thing would be a bot mode where you see that wealth gets reallocated pretty quickly
